# hello-world

Hello everybody

Daniele here, I like concurrent programming, Linux, python, SQL. I studied software engineering in Italy but before finishing the course I had to move to England and get just a job to get my bills paid but to get my mind busy I started learning foreign languages.
I speak Italian,Spanish,German,English and I'm obviously learning Cantonese.
I'm now doing a bootcamp with Firebrand called Junior Software Developer since I'm still looking for a job in IT. I've got the Microsoft Blablabla certification but I feel like employers will be much happier to look at my real code.
That's why i came on GitHub.
Ideally I'd like to contribute to Linux as there's always something to do.
I'm available 5 days per week as I'm working part time on the weekend only.

I want to get involved in some project activity working from home. It's the only thing that really motivates me to learn.

I have some knowledge of the followings -> Pascal, Java, C++, Oracle SQL, Microsoft SQL, C#, ASP.NET, JavaScript, CSS, HTML
Linux distros I like: Archlinux, Gentoo, Debian.

And that is it really
